          <h4>Everybody wants to work with Customer Experience, especially here in Denmark.</h4>
          <hr class="entry-hr" />
          <p>
            Advertising agencies are shifting their focus from branding and ads to Customer Experience, self-proclaimed ‘CX-thought leaders’ are writing books on how changes in customer behaviours are changing what sort of customers, companies should
            focus on and management consultancies are arguing for a shift to a more customer-focused way of planning business activities. Everything is about the customer, and the customer experience, because now-a-days companies have to be
            customer-centric, take an outside-in perspective, and have an agile mindset so they are able to respond to the market in an ongoing pace. opstår store problemer og meget konflikt, hvis løsningen ikke accepteres nærmest uden forbehold. Det
            modsatte af agilitet.
          </p>
          <p>
            And with the proliferation of Customer Experience Management comes a wealth of new methodologies, that allows you to work more customer centric. The most prominent of these is of course Design Thinking, that is used equally as a strategic
            management tool, a framework for innovation and product development and, of course, in designing customer experiences. The methodology is promoted by an army of product-, service- and ux-designers, where the idea is to create the most
            seamless and frictionless customer experience across touchpoints.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem, however, with this line of thinking, is that it effectively creates an incentive for companies within the same category or industry to create the same customer experience. This is because products and services in a digital
            age can be copied by the competition. And this leaves the customer with no discerning way of how to choose between options.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’ve ever worked with Conversion Rate Optimization on digital channels(CRO), you’ve most definitely run into an issue that Andrew Chen elegantly has described as Conservation of Intent. His point is, that a customers’ level of intent
            on making a purchase (or completing any sort of ‘conversion’ or interaction) is mostly constant. Any effort in trying to make the customer experience more frictionless might drive more customers through the funnel, but it ultimately will
            not increase their level of intent, which is why a 10% increase in conversion at one step in the journey does not equal a 10% increase on the bottom line. Most of your customers have such a low-intent, that even though you are able to
            push them down further through the funnel using CRO, you aren’t converting more people because effectively you are not increasing their level of intent.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an aside, why are businesses even considering the 10% increase at that one unimportant step in the customer journey at the expense of the bottom line in the first place? Sure, it might do a little good, but it can never be of strategic
            importance if it doesn’t move the needle on the bottom line? I believe it’s a problem produced by the digitization of business. Digital media, tools, and processes carry with them an increased level of transparency. When everything is
            more transparent, more visible, you notice it more. And when you notice something more, you ascribe it more value. This has caused a shift in business measurement culture to prioritize efficiency over effectiveness. To value the
            performance of individual elements, at the expense of the output of the entire value chain. And this ultimately produces bad business decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be more effective, instead of just efficient, i believe you should focus your Customer Experience efforts towards raising your customers level of intent, meaning making them more interested in your product/service (or making that
            product or service more desirable) rather than just creating customer experiences with less friction. This means focusing on how to differentiate yourself in the market, how to give the customer the ability to choose you over your
            competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as Ben Thompson has recognized, market differentiators are increasingly becoming digitized and thus commoditised. What enabled you to differentiate yourself before, is now easily copyable in a digital world. This means that the
            businesses that win are the ones delivering the best user experience. Ben Thompson uses the example of how AirBnB have digitized (and commoditised) trust in the hotel or accommodation category, and thus by delivering a better user
            experience than the incumbents have won. Even though Ben uses the word user experience, he acknowledges that you shouldn’t think about it as just your interaction on the AirBnB website, but the entirety of all your “customer interactions”
            with the product, from website to visit to stay to review and everything in between. Thats why i would call it customer experience instead, as it denotes the entire customer journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            And how does one deliver the best customer experience then? Well, you of course use the two main assets over which your business holds an effective monopoly (and that which allows you to differentiate yourself in a market), your brand and
            your first-party data. In the case of AirBnB this includes how customers view the AirBnB brand, and how AirBnB use first-party data (individual peoples homes, individual peoples pictures of their homes uploaded to the proprietary
            platform) to create a customer experience, thats differentiated from competitors like hotels.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            But how do you use the two? By raising the level of economic value you deliver to the market from a service to an experience. As the authors of The Experience Economy, Pine & Gillmore, have argued: In the age of the internet, services are
            no longer able to create differentiated economic value in a market. Unless you want to see your business become commoditized, you’ll want to start focus on creating experiences in stead of just services and products.
          </p>
          <p>
            What then, is the defining characteristic (in an economic sense) of an experience vs a service? Its time! Services work effectively by saving you time, but experiences are defined by making the time well spent. Thats why it’s about
            leveraging your brand and first-party data to create customer experiences, that take time. Not because it creates a stronger emotional attachment to the brand, brand love if you will, but because it creates stronger memories.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not our experiences that influence our future decisions, but rather our memories of said experiences, or as Daniel Kahnemann puts it, our remembering-self. Brands exist to reduce the complexity of decision making when facing
            purchase decisions through the mental availability of the brand. This is also why the idea of using a purpose, ie. some sort of societal issue, to position your brand is counterintuitive. Having to decide on a brand by thinking about what
            sort of societal issue it supports runs counter to the idea, that brand exists so you dont have to think, like Wiemer Snijders also argues in the excellent Eat Your Greens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mental availability of a brand is created through our former customer experiences, of purchasing the brand but also of experiencing advertising, experiencing the brand personality, tone-of-voice, aesthetics, interacting with customer
            services etc. If (good) memories of this are available to us in the deciding moment, it’s easier for us to make that decision.
          </p>
          <p>And thats ultimately what creates the most frictionless customer experience: A customer that is easily able to select your brand.</p>
